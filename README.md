## About

Are you in a rushing to put together a last-minute outfit? Tired of endlessly sifting through the same old pile of clothes?

Git Thrifty is the ultimate, one-stop, thrift shopping app (Say that 10x fast) designed to cater to all your clothing needs and occasions. 

With Git Thrifty, you can say goodbye to those long checkout lines and enjoy our hassle-free Shoping Cart and Checkout System. The Git Thrifty allows users to make a Product Selection by clicking ‘Add-To-Cart’ button, or if they have a change of heart, simply press the ‘Remove from Cart’ button to delete the item from the cart and from the rendered list simultaneously.

The user can view Cart Contents easily with a rendered list that displays the items they’ve added. When users are ready to complete their purchase here’s what they can expect to happen with the Checkout system: 1.) The system calculates and displays the total amount to be paid. 2.) Checkout prompts the user to fill out a credit card form. Note that sensitive card information is treated securely, and is hidden from view. 3.) Upon submitting the form, the system performs the following actions: a.) the Form is logged for recordkeeping, b.) the Form fields are cleared and ready for the next transaction, c.) the Shopping Cart price total is reset to zero in preparation for future purchases, d.) Upon completing the purchase, a Confirmation Alert is prompted to ensure a secure and successful transaction.
